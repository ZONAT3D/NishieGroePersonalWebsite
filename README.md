# React + Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

## Features

- Uses React as the front-end framework
- Built with Vite for fast and lightweight development
- Includes basic ESLint rules for code quality and consistency
- Supports TypeScript (see [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for integration instructions)

## Configuration

This project uses the following configuration files:

- `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript settings
- `.gitignore` to ignore generated files and directories

## Credits

Based on the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
